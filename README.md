# COMP 3123 - Assignment Two - Full Stack Development I

**Student Name**: Mo Harry Bandukda  
**Student ID**: 101451857  

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a **Full-Stack Web Application** built with **React.js** (frontend) and **Node.js** (backend), utilizing **MongoDB** for the database and **Axios** for API requests. The user interface is styled with **Material-UI**, and the entire application is containerized using **Docker** for ease of deployment.  

The application provides CRUD operations for both users and employees, with an additional **search functionality** to filter employees by department and position.

## üìã Prerequisites

No installation is required! The project is fully containerized using **Docker Compose**, so all dependencies are handled automatically.
